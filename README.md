# kbc-python-quiz-game
A Python-based Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) quiz game simulating the popular TV show's format. It features lifelines (50-50, audience poll, phone-a-friend), dynamic scoring, and a command-line interface. Built using Python, the game enhances skills in loops, logic, and exception handling. Future plans include a GUI and an expanded question bank.
